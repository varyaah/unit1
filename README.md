# unit1

For project one, I began by coding out the elements on the page in html. One of the elements was the table, the other was a series of input fields and buttons. I linked an external javascript and css file. In the javascript file, I declared the array called inventory. I then retrieved the elements on the page by their id, such as the submit button and input fields. Then I initialized three mock entries to appear on the table and then defined two different functions: one to update the table and one to retrieve input. I added an event listener to add to the inventory list when the onsubmit button is pressed. Finally, I styled the page using pink and blue colors. 

For project 2, i followed a similar approach for the html code but I altered the table to now be an unordered list. In my javascript file, I begin by appending a close button and onclick event to each unordered list item. Additionally, I appended a toggle feature to each entry in the unordered list. This effectively allowed for a styled ‘completed’ feature. Finally, rather than an event listener, I added an onclick event to the button that would trigger a method which would dynamically search for input fields before appending another list element. This means the elements never needed storage in the js file. I once again styled the css, this time making sure to include the toggled list element styles.
